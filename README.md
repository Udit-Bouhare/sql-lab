Welcome to my **SQL Projects Portfolio**! 🚀  
This repository contains my SQL-based projects, showcasing **database design, queries, stored procedures, triggers, indexing, transactions, and optimization techniques**.  
Each project is organized into its own folder with schema, queries, and documentation.
